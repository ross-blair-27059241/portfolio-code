# About this Code

The `crowdstrike_api_metrics.py` script was produced to determine the breakdown of detections generated by a Crowdstrike EDR deployment over a certain period of time.  Special interest was taken in the percentage of total detections generated by Crowdstrike's "Falcon Overwatch" analysis service.  These metrics were requested by leadership during a proof-of-concept of the CrowdStrike EDR product.
