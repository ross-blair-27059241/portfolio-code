# About This Project

## The Project's Goal & Components

Project Visindi's end goal is to provide operational documentation and strategic perspective to all members of a security program: from an entry-level Analyst to the Chief Information Security Officer \(CISO\).  The foundational tool that helps achieve this goal is a collection of documents and code called the Detection & Response Strategic Framework \(DRSF\).

On a technical level, the DRSF consists of three main components:
1. A core DRSF codebase that can programatically create, read, process, and analyze formalized documentation files.  These documentation files are referred to throughout the project as "DRSF source documents".
2. A Jupyter Notebook file called the "DRSF Workbench" which uses config and input files to harness the core DRSF codebase to create, modify, and analyze DRSF source documents.
3. The output DRSF source documents, which are built into a Jupyter Book for processing into multiple desired formats \(e.g. static web-page, pdf, etc.\)
